# Preface

## Description

I usually use bruce schneier's Sensible Security Model when threat modelling. With this book I've focussed on identifying and addressing the risks and countermeasures that I see most common in Docker deployments. This is targeted toward the DevOps and Software Engineer in a hurry.

## Purpose

My intention with this book is for it to serve as a reference to help you increase the likelihood of resisting attacks from your adversaries, at the same time not getting bogged down in hundreds of pages of content.

This book is supposed to augment the Cisecurity Benchmark for Docker. Read it in conjunction, that's also what works for me, so I'm hoping it will for you also.

## Reason

My tech communities encouraged me to put on paper what was in my head. I also hosted an interview with Docker Security Team Lead Diogo MÃ³nica, in which I performed a couple of weeks research. I thought it made sense to consolidate as much of my knowledge and experience around Docker security as I had quickly accessible, then to pass it on to you to help improve the security posture of your Docker deployments.
