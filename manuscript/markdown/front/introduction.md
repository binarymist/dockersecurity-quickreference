# Introduction

Docker Security - Quick Reference addresses the issues that I have had most commonly with Docker deployments requiring a decent level of security.

One aspect, in-fact, almost certainly the most important regarding Docker security, is that Software Developers often neglect application security. I've written about application security extensively in other books, so I've taken the assumption that you understand it to be of utmost importance when it comes to defending you and your organisations assets, and that you have already invested significantly into application security..

I hope this book serves you well in providing the knowledge you will need to harden your Docker deployments.
